:dizzy: Hi! My name is Thales Kenne, I'm from Santa Maria/RS, Brazil.

More than a developer, I'm an _entrepreneur_. I look around me and try to find ways I can improve people's lives and that reflects in the way I code. I like building quick apps and failing fast if must be.

> **:star: My largest projects are the codes I ran my startups with, ask me if you want to check out the repositories :star:**
